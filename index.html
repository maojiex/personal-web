            <h4>CS5200 Database Management System</h4>
            <p>Introduces relational database management systems as a class of software systems. Prepares students to be sophisticated users of database management systems. Covers design theory, query language, and performance/tuning issues. Topics include relational algebra, SQL, stored procedures, user-defined functions, cursors, embedded SQL programs, client-server interfaces, entity-relationship diagrams, normalization, B-trees, concurrency, transactions, database security, constraints, object-relational DBMSs, and specialized engines such as spatial, text, XML conversion, and time series. Includes exercises using a commercial relational or object-relational database management system.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ctag">
            <h4>CS5520 Mobile Application Development</h4>
            <p>Focuses on mobile application development on a mobile phone or related platform. Discusses memory management; user interface building, including both MVC principles and specific tools; touch events; data handling, including core data, SQL, XML, and JSON; network techniques and URL loading; and, finally, specifics such as GPS and motion sensing that may be dependent on the particular mobile platform. Students are expected to work on a project that produces a professional-quality mobile application and to demonstrate the application that they have developed. The instructor chooses a modern mobile platform to be used in the course.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ctag">
            <h4>CS5800 Algorithms</h4>
            <p>Presents the mathematical techniques used for the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Focuses on algorithmic design paradigms and techniques for analyzing the correctness, time, and space complexity of algorithms. Topics may include asymptotic notation, recurrences, loop invariants, Hoare triples, sorting and searching, advanced data structures, lower bounds, hashing, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ctag">
            <h4>CS5010 Programming Design Paradigm</h4>
            <p>Introduces modern program design paradigms. Starts with functional program design, introducing the notion of a design recipe. The latter consists of two parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). The course then progresses to object-oriented design, explaining how it generalizes and contrasts with functional design. In addition to studying program design, students also have an opportunity to practice pair-programming and public code review techniques, as found in industry today.</p>
